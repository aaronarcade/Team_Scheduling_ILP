# Team_Scheduling_ILP
Team scheduling for Non-profit project teams by preferenceand class rank (maybe by skills and time availability too)

Below is the current confusion matrix of preference vs. assignment. The three black points are poor matching and will require manual movement into a different team. These are unlikely to occur in a real dataset, as all members will select a range of projects to work on, thus reducing the chances the script will place them in a poorly matched team. 

Exec board may know after the teams have been unoffically assigned that some members need to be moved onto a more demanding/intensive team, so these would be the first to move.

I'm pleased with the current progress of the script and for the Fall 2019 semester, I feel confident that this will work.
Will update after next semester for Spring 2020.
